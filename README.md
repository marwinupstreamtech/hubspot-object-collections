# HubSpot CRM object collection

A Laravel package can help to collect the HubSpot CRM objects properties

## Inspiration

Here are a few examples of well-documented code:

* [HubSpot](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/companies)
## Usage & formatting

This Readme template is written using Markdown. See [GitHub's instructions on writing in Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) if you aren't familiar.

Usage:

1. In your repository, create a new file and name it `README.md`.
2. Copy and paste the below template in your README.md
3. Edit the text as needed for your project

**Note** Text in `*italics*` (as under `Getting started`) indicates template instructions that should be replaced with text specific to the project. Regular text (as under `Errors and bugs`) indicates a standard block of text that you can copy/paste directly.

## The template

```
# *Project title*

*Short description of your project, in one or two sentences.* 

## Setup 

### Dependencies

*Provide links and descriptions for the third-party libraries you're having your users install.*

### Installation

* Mac OS X
* Ubuntu
* Windows (if applicable)

### Getting started

*What does your user need to know to get everything ready after installation?*
*Think about databases, config files, and settings.*

## Usage

*Give your users a sense of the workflow for using your project/tool.*
*For a website this might include code for running locally.*
*For an API this might include method and parameter specs.*

## Demo

*Grab a simple block of code that makes use of your project/tool and paste it here.*

## Team

* *Name, Organization - role or tasks worked on*

*Add a "contributors" section if you've incorporated pull requests.*
